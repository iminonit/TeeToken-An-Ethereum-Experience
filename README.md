# TeeToken: An Ethereum Experience

 Our Whitepaper can be found here: 
 
 Our Smart Contract was developed by LetzGro Solutions. Ihor Pidruchny and Andrew Zubko were brilliant partners to work with.

We were excited to work with a smart contract auditor to ensure all code was at the very least ...secure. Contract code security is highly specialized work, we expected it to be expensive and are happy to say...all quotes exceeded expectations.

So, we are not going through a contract audit that puts a medium size business like ourselves in financial strain. 

The quality of our T-Shirts is audited by experts with 20+ years of garment manufacturing experience. We will make sure that you receive a high quality representation of Ethereum and strive to make it better!

On to the Contract Methods:

Set Locked: Allows us (TeeToken/inonit) to lock contract functionality to the extent that the gas price to interact with the contract is unresonably high. Why did we do this? Unforeseen circumstances could lead to such a requirement, what those circumstances are, we are yet to find out.

Add Reward: This method allows the contract owner to fund the smart contract address with the Ether reward that token holders may claim, the “Recycle Time” field denotes the timeframe in which token holders may claim the Ether reward, if some token holders dont do so in the predetermined and published timeframe, The contract owner will be able to reclaim the Ether.

Recycle Reward: This locks all Ether from token claims during the timeframe in which TeeToken holders can claim the reward. This functionality is a contingency. We have no intent of using it. Our smart is not audited for security. We are yet to learn what circumstances may require us to use this function.

Refund Unclaimed Ether: If the reward timeframe has passed, the contract owner may call this method to retreive Ether from the contract.   Please note: We are very committed to making sure your ethereum experience is seamless, it is our responsibility to remind you that Ethereum and smart contracts are experimental technology, that’s why TeeTokens were conceptualized as a FREE VALUE ADDED SERVICE.

Transfer Ownership: This method allows us to transfer contract ownership to another Ethereum address if such a requirement is necessary.


If you or someone you know would be willing to inform us of any contract logic fallacies that we may have overlooked, please refrain from doing so in public forum, a sizable portion of teetokens will be given to charitable groups and we want their ether rebates to be processed as smoothly as possible.
